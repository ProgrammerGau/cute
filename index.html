    My life was blue
When I met you
Been through a lot
My heart became so hard
My life's so hard
Baby why are you so alone?
I can't let go
I wanna make you smile
Coz I love you...
More than this planet, the universe, the galaxies
To the stars and the moon that shines brightly
You were the taste of sky
That I want forever
Just a taste of happy feeling in this cruel world
You were between imaginations and burning real
You were the taste of sky that I can't keep.
Ohhh
Your eyes was blue and I need you
But baby this world needs you too
What can I do?
What can I do?!
Baby don't cry
I don't wanna leave you
I just needed to
Even though
I love you
More than this planet, the universe, the galaxies
To the stars and the moon that shines brightly
You were the taste of sky
That I want forever
Just a taste of happy feeling in this cruel world
You were between imaginations and burning real
You were the taste of sky that I can't keep.
Can you stay by my side?
I wanna stay by your side
Then just choose me!
As much as I wanted to
But we can't
Just let the sky cross our paths again.My life was blue

Even though
I love you
More than this planet, the universe, the galaxies
To the stars and the moon that shines brightly
You were the taste of sky
That I want forever
Just a taste of happy feeling in this cruel world
You were between imaginations and burning real
You were the taste of sky that I can't keep.
Can you stay by my side?
I wanna stay by your side
Then just choose me!
As much as I wanted to
But we can't
Just let the sky cross our paths again.My life was blue
When I met you
Been through a lot
My heart became so hard
My life's so hard
Baby why are you so alone?
I can't let go
I wanna make you smile
Coz I love you...
More than this planet, the universe, the galaxies
To the stars and the moon that shines brightly
You were the taste of sky
That I want forever
Just a taste of happy feeling in this cruel world
You were between imaginations and burning real
You were the taste of sky that I can't keep.
Ohhh
Your eyes was blue and I need you
But baby this world needs you too
What can I do?
What can I do?!
Baby don't cry
I don't wanna leave you
I just needed to
Even though
I love you
